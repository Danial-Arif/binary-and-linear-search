# binary-and-linear-search
I implemented Binary Search and Linear Search to solidify my understanding of searching algorithms. This repo includes clear, well-documented code with time complexity analysis and worst-case scenarios. It reflects my learning process and dedication to writing clean, efficient, and easy-to-understand solutions.
